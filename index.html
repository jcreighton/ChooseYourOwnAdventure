							<div>You are an intergalactic engineer with a perplexing mystery to solve. Your ship, the SSH Code, has received a distress signal from a nearby planet, ECMA.</div>
							<div>“Something is wrong. Our systems are in disarray. Help.”</div>			
							<div>You landed on the planet a few minutes ago. You are standing in front of a small building where the distress signal is originating from. “Hello!”, you call out.</div>

							<div>“THANK GOODNESS YOU ARE HERE!”, a voice yells. “It’s been days and the alerts keep growing and we aren’t sure why and it’s not stopping. And I didn’t know if anyone would see the distress signal.”</div>
							<div>The ECMIAN stares, wide-eyed and hopeful, at you.</div>
							<div>“Oh, I should introduce myself. I’m W. Orld, Chief Operating Officer of ECMA. Usually I wouldn’t need to send out a distress signal but our engineers are at JSConf Earth and the reports keep coming and I… I need help.”</div>
							<div>“Hello, W. Orld. I saw the distress signal and I’m happy to help however I can. What are the reports you spoke of?”</div>
							<div>W. Orld opens what appears to be a book but is soon revealed to be an electronic map. “This is up-to-date with the latest reports. From what we’re seeing, it’s the arrays. Or some of them. We’re receiving different reports but it appears some are out of order. But others are working as expected. It’s throwing various systems into chaos.”</div>

							<div>You’ll need more information and as W. Orld has suggested, the nearest reports could help clue you in to where these array disruptions could be coming from.</div>
